This accelerometer data taken at 6 Flags Magic Mountain in Los Angeles, CA. Taken with the Sensor Kinetic App on my Samsung Infuse. Ontheroad.acc is data from a car ride, not an actual ride.

Initial Velocity of Zero as the program was running in my pocket for a decent but arbitrary number of seconds while waiting for the ride to start.
