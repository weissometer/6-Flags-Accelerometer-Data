This accelerometer data taken at 6 Flags Magic Mountain in Los Angeles, CA. Taken with the Sensor Kinetic App on my Samsung Infuse. Ontheroad.acc is data from a car ride, not an actual ride.

Initial Velocity of Zero as the program was running in my pocket for a decent but arbitrary number of seconds while waiting for the ride to start.

On-The-Road.acc:
Look at Google Maps and this will make more sense

For sure it was on the road between Lancaster, CA and Santa Clarita, CA
The recording started at 9:09 AM
We got to the park Just after 10
So somewhere on the 14, probably after Palmdale.
